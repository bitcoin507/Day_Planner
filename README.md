## Intro
A simple planner to keep organised. I have made this simple planner.Just add your info into the text area and click the button in the middle to save. I added smooth scroll so that when you click the button it scrolls up where you can see a thumbs up to let you know info has been saved. The thumbs up img strts off hidden and I added event listeners to the buttons to show the image on click.The days are color coded. 

The buttons were supposed to be at the end of the
 div not in the middle. I tried to reposition but I cant figure out why I cannot get them in the desired position.
