# Day_Planner
A simple planner to keep organised. I have made this simple planner. I added smooth scroll so that when you click the button it scrolls up where you can see a thumbs up to let you know info has been saved.The days are color coded.

The buttons were supposed to be at the end of the
 div not in the middle. I tried to reposition but I cant figure out why I cannot get them in the desired position.
